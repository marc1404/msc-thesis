Taste: Rather strange mix of below medium sweet, soft sour and lightly salty notes and some pretty weird spicy candy-like notes, probably the seaweed. Thin body, a bit like flavored spring water. Below average carbonation. Very different from the gose beers I have tasted in Goslar, although I have to admit the the typical salty notes are more present in this beer. Interesting style. Refreshing. Overall not really my beer, but I am glad I had the change to taste it."

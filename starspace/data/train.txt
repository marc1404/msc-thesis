Eerste indruk dit een topper maar waarom geven ze zichzelf een Zachte volle licht bruine schuimkraag die perfect bij het onderliggende diep donker bruine biertje past waar je de gisting door heen ziet dwarrelen Het heeft een hele zoete sterke fruit geur zware tonen van perzik Je proeft zware donkere herfst fruit van o rozijnen perzik maar ook banaan Dit een super complex biertje wat je constant nieuw smaak sensaties geeft Redelijke bitter je proeft ook wel iets van koffie chocola achtig maar onmiskenbaar zeker geen imperial stout Quadruppels hebben nogal eens de neiging om alcoholisch te proeven maar deze heb je niet eens door dat het ruim procent Overall niet gewoon maar met recht een topper En wat deze bijzonder maakt dat hij het illustere rijtje top bieren kan scharen die ook nog eens gewoon de betere supermarkt te koop Chapeau Moet ook echt bekennen dat ik deze echt beter vindt als Westvletteren waarvan ik met veel moeite nog een sixpack de kast heb staan Terwijl ik voor rochefort alleen op de volgende bonus van AH hoef te wachten lol mmm laatste toch echt stukken aantrekkelijker als je mij vraagt Alleen daarom al een waard
